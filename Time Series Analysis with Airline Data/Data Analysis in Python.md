# Unveiling Heat Maps for Monthly Data Analysis in Python

## Beginning the Journey

will dive deeper into the more complex visualizations using the Seaborn library to plot heat maps.

Heat maps are a superb tool for displaying multivariate datasets in a two-dimensional image. They visually represent data through colors, where different color gradients represent different values. This is very useful in fields like Data Science, as heat maps are powerful tools for exploring and understanding patterns in a given dataset.

In our context of analyzing air travel data, what if we could find out how the monthly passenger count has fluctuated over the years? Which month or year had the highest passenger count? Does the count exhibit a pattern or trend? Heat maps are a great tool to answer these questions, and we'll learn to do exactly that in this lesson.

## Delving Into Heat Maps

Heat maps are generated using the `Seaborn` library, which builds on `Matplotlib` and integrates seamlessly with pandas data structures. Let's start by developing a heat map for monthly passenger trends in air travel.

We start by loading up the `flights` dataset, as before:

```Python

import seaborn as sns

# Load the dataset
flights = sns.load_dataset('flights')
```
Since our interest is on a year-by-year and month-by-month basis, a pivot table fits our requirements best. The pivot table will have months as rows, years as columns, and passenger counts as the cell values. Python's pandas library makes creating this pivot table straightforward:

```Python

# Pivot the dataset
flights_pivot = flights.pivot(index="month", columns="year", values="passengers")
print(flights_pivot)
"""

```
Now that we have our pivot table, we can create a heat map. We use Seaborn's heatmap() function, passing in our pivot table as an argument:

```Python

# Plot a heatmap
sns.heatmap(flights_pivot)

plt.show()
```

This heat map immediately provides insight into the passenger count over the years. The color gradient (warmer for higher values, cooler for lower values) makes it easy to spot patterns and trends over time.

## Enhancing Your Heat Maps

Seaborn offers several parameters to customize heatmaps for better readability and presentation. Here, we'll revamp our heatmap by tinkering with these parameters:

`cmap`: This parameter controls the colormap for the heat map. Different colormaps can be used to enhance the heat map's visual appeal and help interpret the data better.
`annot`: If set to True, this parameter allows the data values to be written on each cell in the heat map.
`fmt`: This is a string formatting code to use when adding annotations. While it's unnecessary when the `annot` is not `True`, you need to specify a string formatting code if you add annotations.
`linewidths`: This parameter allows adding lines between each cell in the heatmap. This helps to distinguish between each cell, especially when the colors amongst cells do not vary greatly.
`cbar`: This parameter adds a color bar to the heatmap when set to True. The color bar helps in understanding the color coding of the heatmap cells.
`center`: This parameter defines the value at which to center the colormap. This is useful in cases where the heatmap cells take values diverging around zero.
Let's experiment with these parameters and enhance our heatmap:

```Python

# Detailed heat map
sns.heatmap(flights_pivot, 
            cmap='YlGnBu', # choosing a yellow-green-blue colormap
            annot=True, # Turning on annotations
            fmt="d", # displaying annotations as integer
            linewidths=.5, # Add gridlines with width 0.5
            cbar=True, # Include color bar
            center = flights_pivot.loc["Jan", 1955] # Center colormap at the value of passengers in January 1955
)
plt.show()
```

Running this code block would produce a more detailed heat map. The numbers in each cell correspond to the actual count of passengers. There are lines of width 0.5 distinguishing every two heatmap cells. The color bar to the right of the heatmap serves as a reference for interpreting the heatmap colors. The center parameter ensures that the colormap's neutral point corresponds to the number of passengers in January 1955.

## Analyzing with Heat Maps

We can quickly spot a significant insight: as the years go on, the passenger count increases, indicating the growth in the air travel industry. Moreover, we can observe a pattern in passenger counts attaining a peak during the summers each year, displaying the seasonality in air travel.

In this case, "seasonality" refers to a periodic and consistent fluctuation in the number of passengers over different months of the year. This type of pattern often occurs when the observations are collected over time. For instance, a school might display seasonality in electricity consumption, using more during the academic year and less during the holidays.
