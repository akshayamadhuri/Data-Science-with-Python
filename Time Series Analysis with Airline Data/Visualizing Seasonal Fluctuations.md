# Analyzing and Visualizing Seasonal Fluctuations with Python

## Topic Overview

This lesson aims to spotlight monthly fluctuations in passenger counts over a span of 11 years and illustrate these trends using Python, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Put on your data science goggles as we embark on a journey to the heart of Time Series Data Analysis, a robust statistical tool with data points indexed at successive equally spaced points. This is paramount in many practical fields such as economics, finance, biology, physics, and, of course, in our study- aviation, where we delve into the history and future predictions of air travel.

In essence, why do you need to know about seasonal fluctuations? Imagine overseeing airline operations. You would want to accommodate peak travel times by scheduling more flights, ensuring adequate staff, or planning the maintenance and downtime of aircraft accordingly. It can also be invaluable information if you are in the travel industry or even for passengers looking to plan their travel when it’s less crowded. The applications are limitless!

## Unveiling Month-Wise Trends with Line Plots

Now, let’s extend that knowledge to analyze seasonal fluctuations. This time, we strive to discern if there's a pattern emerging over the months, regardless of the year.

To achieve this, we need an aggregated passenger' count for each month over the years. For the task, Python's Pandas library and its groupby function can be quite beneficial. Let's walk through it.

```Python

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load the flights dataset
flights_data = sns.load_dataset('flights')

# Aggregate passengers' count for each month
month_wise_data = flights_data.groupby('month')['passengers'].sum().reset_index()

# Create line plots
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 8))
plt.plot(month_wise_data['month'], month_wise_data['passengers'], marker='o')
plt.grid(True)
plt.title('Month-wise Number of Passengers (1949 - 1960)', fontsize=14)
plt.xlabel('Month', fontsize=12)
plt.ylabel('Number of Passengers', fontsize=12)
plt.show()
```

By executing this code block, the line plot produced will represent each month on the x-axis, with the total number of passengers on the y-axis. This visually reveals if there is a repeating pattern in passenger volumes over the different months.

`reset_index()` is used after the groupby operation to move the 'month' from the index to a regular column, as by default, when you perform a grouping operation (like groupby) in a DataFrame, the grouped column becomes the index of the DataFrame.

## A Look at Other Categories

Let's extend our knowledge to analyze the year column in our dataset using a similar approach:

```Python

# Year-wise passenger distribution
year_wise_data = flights_data.groupby('year')['passengers'].sum()

year_wise_data.plot(kind='line', marker='o')
plt.xlabel("Year", fontsize=12)
plt.ylabel("Number of Passengers", fontsize=12)
plt.title("Year-wise Number of Passengers (1949 - 1960)", fontsize=14)
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

## Customizing Your Plot

Not only does the `plot()` method enable us to generate various types of charts, but it also allows us to adjust many parameters for better visualization.

`color`: Sets the color of the plot.
`alpha`: Sets the transparency level.
`grid`: Whether or not to display grid lines.
Let's experiment with these parameters:

```Python

year_wise_data.plot(kind='line', marker='o', color='skyblue', alpha=0.7, grid=True)
plt.xlabel("Year", fontsize=12)
plt.ylabel("Number of Passengers", fontsize=12)
plt.title("Year-wise Number of Passengers (1949 - 1960)", fontsize=14)
plt.show()
```
