Numpy, short for Numerical Python, is an essential library for performing numerical computations in Python. 
It has support for arrays (like lists in Python, but can store items of the same type), multidimensional arrays, matrices, and a large collection of high-level mathematical functions.

In the world of data manipulation using Python, understanding and being able to use Numpy arrays allows us to efficiently manage numerical data.
